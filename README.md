## Hi there 👋

<!--# Blue Team Portfolio — samberr23

Hi — I'm Sam (GitHub: samberr23). This repo contains short blue-team writeups, detection notes, and small scripts from my TryHackMe and Splunk learning path.  
I focus on incident triage, log analysis, and building repeatable searches and dashboards.

## How to use this repo
- Each writeup is in `writeups/<name>/README.md`.  
- Place screenshots in `writeups/<name>/screenshots/` and link them relative to the writeup.  
- `scripts/` contains small helper scripts for log parsing and automation.

**samberr23/samberr23** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
